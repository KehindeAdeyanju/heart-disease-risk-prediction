🫀 Heart Disease Risk Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical patient data.
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
📌 Project Overview
Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity worldwide.
This project uses Logistic Regression to estimate the likelihood of heart disease based on patient features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other clinical indicators.
